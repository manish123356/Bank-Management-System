# 💼 Bank Management System - Java Console Application

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Bank Management System** is a complete console-based application developed using **Java**. It simulates the core operations of a banking system, including account creation, balance inquiry, deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, and account management. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and file handling in Java, and is ideal for understanding how back-end banking operations are structured.

Designed with simplicity and extensibility in mind, the application provides a smooth user experience in a command-line interface and serves as a foundational tool for anyone interested in financial software systems or Java development.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Simulate real-world banking operations.
- Learn and apply OOP principles in Java.
- Implement robust user data handling using file I/O or database (if applicable).
- Build a modular, maintainable Java application.

## ⚙️ Core Features

- ✅ **Create New Bank Account**
- 💰 **Deposit Money**
- 💸 **Withdraw Money**
- 🔄 **Transfer Funds Between Accounts**
- 🧾 **Check Account Balance**
- 📄 **View Account Details**
- 🗂️ **List All Accounts**
- ❌ **Close an Account**
- 📝 **Update Account Information**
- 🔐 **Secure Access (Optional: Password or PIN-based authentication)**

> All operations are handled using object-oriented programming concepts and Java classes with strong encapsulation and separation of concerns.

## 🧱 Project Architecture

- **Account.java** – Contains all properties and behaviors of a bank account (account number, holder name, balance, etc.).
- **Bank.java** – Main logic for processing transactions and managing accounts.
- **Main.java** – Handles user interface and navigation.
- **FileHandler.java** *(if used)* – Manages reading/writing to files for persistent data storage.
- **Utilities.java** *(optional)* – Contains helper functions such as input validation, ID generation, etc.
